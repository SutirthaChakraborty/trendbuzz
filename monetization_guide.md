## Google AdSense Integration

Google AdSense is one of the easiest ways to monetize your website. Here's how to set it up:

### Step 1: Create a Google AdSense Account
1. Go to [Google AdSense](https://www.google.com/adsense/start/)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Fill in your website information and contact details
4. Submit your application
5. Wait for approval (typically takes 1-3 days)

### Step 2: Add AdSense Code to Your Website
Once approved, replace the placeholder ad code in `js/ads.js` with your actual AdSense code:

```javascript
// Replace this in the loadAdSense function
const adScript = document.createElement('script');
adScript.async = true;
adScript.src = 'https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js';
adScript.setAttribute('data-ad-client', 'ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'); // Your publisher ID
document.head.appendChild(adScript);

// Replace placeholder ads with actual AdSense units
function replaceAdPlaceholders() {
    // Get all ad placeholders
    const adPlaceholders = {
        top: document.getElementById('ad-top'),
        middle: document.getElementById('ad-middle'),
        bottom: document.getElementById('ad-bottom')
    };
    
    // Replace each placeholder with AdSense code
    for (const [position, element] of Object.entries(adPlaceholders)) {
        if (element) {
            element.innerHTML = `
                <ins class="adsbygoogle"
                    style="display:block"
                    data-ad-client="ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX" // Your publisher ID
                    data-ad-slot="XXXXXXXXXX" // Your ad slot ID for this position
                    data-ad-format="auto"
                    data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins>
            `;
            
            // Execute AdSense code
            (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        }
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Optimize Ad Placements

- Above the fold (top of the page)
